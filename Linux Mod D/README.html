  <h1>Welcome to Linux Module D!</h1>
  <h2>The purpose of this module is to introduce you to the offensive side of cybersecurity while building upon prior knowledge.</h2>
  <h3>Like in all default kali instances, your credentials are kali:kali.</h3>
</div>

<div class="recon">
  <p>Most offensive cyber (or "red team") starts with reconnaissance about both the target machine and the target user.</p>
  <p>Along with this virtual machine, you have been giving another. Please log into that system with the credentials cyber:lonestar.</p>
  <p>On the ubuntu machine, run the command "sudo ifconfig 192.168.10.10" to manually assign your ip address. This is to keep the lab consistent and easier to follow. In a read situation, the ip address would likely be automatically assigned.</p>
  <p>On your machine, run the command "sudo ifconfig 192.168.10.10" to manually set your ip address. The machines can now talk to one another as they are on the same network. Test this by running "ping 192.168.10.10" on the kali machine. You should get a response telling you how much delay there was between send and recieve.</p>
  <p>Now, we will get familiar with a tool called nmap. Nmap allows someone to scan a network and devices on that network. This can be used by both system administrators and by attackers alike. </p>
